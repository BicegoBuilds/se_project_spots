**Intro**

This project is named Spots. It is an interactive social media web application where users can add and remove photos, and make adjustments to their profile.

**Description**

This web application was created using HTML and CSS. To account for different screen sizes, media queries are used and produce different layouts. Users will be able to edit their profile pictures, profile descriptions, like posts, and create new posts.
